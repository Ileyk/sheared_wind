For describing the wind acceleration, we use the results from \citet{Sander+2018} for Vela X-1. Using the stellar
atmosphere code PoWR \citep[e.g.]{HamannKoesterke1998,Graefener+2002}, they calculate an atmosphere model for the donor star assuming a spherical, stationary
wind situation. The radiative transfer is performed in the comoving frame, allowing to obtain the radiative acceleration
without any further assumptions or parameterizations, i.e.
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:araddef}
    a_\text{rad}(r) & = \frac{4\pi}{c} \frac{1}{\rho(r)}  \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \kappa_\nu H_\nu \mathrm{d}\nu \\
                                & = \frac{16\pi^2}{c} \frac{r^2 \varv(r)}{\dot{M}} \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \kappa_\nu H_\nu \mathrm{d}\nu\text{.}
  \end{align}  
Using the technique described in \citet{Sander+2017}, the model provides a hydrodynamically consistent 
stratification, meaning that the mass-loss rate and the velocity field were iteratively updated such that eventually
the outward and inward forces are balancing each other throughout the stellar atmosphere. The resulting velocity and
density stratification shows notable deviations from the typically assumed $\beta$-law, especially closer to the (donor)
star, where e.g. the obtained wind velocity is slower.

In this work we aim at studying the consequences of the wind acceleration based on these sophisticated atmosphere calculations regarding the resulting accretion scenario in SGXBs. We therefore use the radiative acceleration $a_\text{rad}$ and the acceleration based on thermal and turbulence pressure
  \begin{align} 
    \label{eq:apressdef}
    a_\text{press} & := -\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\mathrm{d}P}{\mathrm{d}r} \\
                   & = - \frac{\mathrm{d}a^2}{\mathrm{d}r} + \frac{2 a^2}{r} + \frac{a^2}{\varv} \frac{\mathrm{d}\varv}{\mathrm{d}r}
  \end{align} 
\citep[cf.][]{Sander+2015} with $P = P_\text{gas} + P_\text{turb}$ or - written via $P = \rho a^2$ in terms of velocities - 
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:asounddef}
    a^2(r) := & \frac{\mathcal{R} T(r)}{\mu(r)} + \frac{1}{2} \varv_\text{mic}^2\text{.}
\end{align}
Despite the non-spherical situation due to the NS companion, we adopt $a_\text{rad}$ as $a_\text{press}$ as functions
of distance from the donor star here for simplicity.

--- if you also use the temperature ---

The temperature stratification in the stellar atmosphere model is computed consistently with the solution of the statistical equations and the radiative transfer, but not considering any X-ray irradiation on the donor star. Based on the assumption of radiative equilibrium, the (electron) temperature structure in an expanding atmosphere is obtained by applying a generalized Uns{\"o}ld-Lucy method described in \citet{HamannGraefener2003}.
